## Coding Challenge Requirements 

## Requirement Specification

### Definition

We're building an employee storage service for companies. 

A company admin needs to be able to:
- create employee records for company,
- view them in a list and detail view for company, 
- update the employee records and delete them for company,
- find the average salary for the company

Your task is to build the backend for this service. 

It should be a rest API that exposes the required endpoints.

The company data can either be autogenerated or configurable or dynamically created. (Up to you)

> Nice to have 1: Build a frontend for the rest api

> Nice to have 2: Use jvm based technologies

### Data definition

- Employee model
  - Name
  - Surname
  - email
  - address
  - salary
  - company id
  
- Company model
  - Name

### Delivery

A publicly available git repository with a README.md that explains how to compile, build and start the project.

## My soulution 

#### How run in IDE (Eclipse, Idea)

1. Run 
     "mvn clean install"
     
2. Run Application.class in any Java IDE

#### How run using jar file and Spring Boot 
1. Run 
     "mvn clean install"
     
2. Run Application.class in codingchallenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, for example 

   java -jar target/codingchallenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    
See more info in [Spring Boot documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-running-your-application.html)

#### How see result in web
Use following link: [https://employee-storage-service.herokuapp.com/](https://employee-storage-service.herokuapp.com/)

### Rest Service 
https://employee-storage-service.herokuapp.com/rest/companies/1/employees (get) - show all employees for companies with id = 1
https://employee-storage-service.herokuapp.com/rest/companies/1 (get) - show information about company with id = 1,
https://employee-storage-service.herokuapp.com/rest/companies (get) - show information about all companies,
https://employee-storage-service.herokuapp.com/rest/companies/2/employees/1 (get) - show employee with id = 1 for company with id = 2,
https://employee-storage-service.herokuapp.com/rest/companies/2/employees (post) - add new employee for company with id = 2, 
https://employee-storage-service.herokuapp.com/rest/companies/2/employees (put) - update employee for company with id = 2, 
https://employee-storage-service.herokuapp.com/rest/companies/2/employees (delete) - delete employee for company with id = 2,
